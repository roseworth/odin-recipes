        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Oreo cookies combine with classic Rice Krispie treats for a delicious cookies and cream version.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>30 chocolate creme sandwich cookies (such as Oreos®)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup salted butter</li>
            <li>1 (16-ounce) bag mini marshmallows</li>
            <li>1 (13-ounce) jar marshmallow cream, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>6 cups crisp rice cereal (such as Rice Krispies®)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Grease a 9 x 13 inch pan with nonstick spray.</li>
            <li>Place the cookies in a resealable bag and use a rolling pin to coarsely crush them–the goal is to end up with mostly larger, bite-sized pieces and less powdery bits (some is ok).</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add mini marshmallows and 1/2 the marshmallow cream. Reduce heat to medium-low, and stir well with a silicone spatula to melt the marshmallows and combine the mixture evenly. Stir in vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Remove mixture from the heat. Add cereal and the powdery portion of the crushed cookies, and stir well to combine. Add larger crushed cookie pieces, and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Dollop about half of the remaining marshmallow cream over the surface of the mixture, and fold a few times to partially incorporate it. Dollop the rest of the marshmallow cream over the surface, and fold a few more times to partially incorporate it. There should be visible streaks of marshmallow cream throughout the mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into the prepared pan, and use a spatula to push it into an even layer and compress it slightly.</li>
            <li>Let the pan sit at room temperature to firm up, 30 minutes to 1 hour, before slicing and serving. Store the pan tightly wrapped in plastic wrap at room temperature. They’re gooiest in the first 24 hours, but will keep well for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
